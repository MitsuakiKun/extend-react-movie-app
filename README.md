# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Mitsuaki Okabe


## Overview.

I have created a multilingual site to make it easier for many people to use the site. Since I am Japanese, I have made the site Japanese compatible first, but since the [string.js](./src/strings.js) database, so you can easily change to more languages by registering language information.
I also created a login function using Firebase Authentication so that only google accounts with @mail.wit.ie can login to the site.
Furthermore, I have created a more user-friendly site with more information on the detail pages.
